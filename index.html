                <p>
                <h3>1. Objectives-</h3><br> The objective of the competition is to create awareness and promote right
                application of concrete mix design principles among professionals, practicing engineers & builders
                having Laboratory testing facilities. Concrete is widely used in construction. However, there is a
                need to create further awareness about the quality of concrete and the growing need to affect
                economy in the face of ever-rising cost of materials. Therefore, mix proportioning of concrete
                assumes a great importance. The mix proportioning for developing improved properties of concrete
                always fascinates a civil engineer. A properly designed concrete for a particular application
                keeping in mind the specific requirements in terms of workability, strength, durability and economy
                can affect substantial savings and long life of the structure. This competition provides an
                opportunity for the students of engineering institutes and the young engineers working in the
                construction field to understand the characteristic behavior of Different proportions of concrete by
                having hands on experience and ultimately arrive at the desired final mix. Practical hands-on
                experience gained by the participants during competition would help them in their future endeavors
                in developing quality concrete.</p>
                <p> Registration fee : 500 /- per group. Max 3 participants <br>
                    Prize Amount : 1st prize – Rs.10,000/- with Certificate <br>
                    2nd Price – Rs.7,000/- with Certificate</p>

                <p>NDT is the process of inspecting, testing, or evaluating materials, components or assemblies for
                    discontinuities, or differences in characteristics without destroying the serviceability of the
                    parts or systems. This workshop aims to demonstrate the hands on experience about NDT to the
                    participants. The workshop will make participants well conversent with the methods of NDT like
                    rebound hammer, ultrasonic pulse velocity etc. The workshop is useful for undergraduate students,
                    post graduate students, research scholars and professional engineers. </p>
